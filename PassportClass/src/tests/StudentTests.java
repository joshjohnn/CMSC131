	/*
	 * Each method in a JUnit StudentTest class represents a test. You can write
	 * code in a method of this class as you do in the main method of a driver. 
	 * As you write your code, define methods in this class that test each of 
	 * the methods you need to implement. When you run a method you can have 
	 * System.out.println statements to see the results of your code. Using 
	 * this approach is simpler than defining driver classes.
	 * 
	 * For this project you don't need to worry about adding assertions (we will
	 * talk about them soon). If you don't add assertions, by default, every test
	 * will pass (so when you run your student tests you will see a green bar).  
	 * We have left two examples of tests below so you can see how you can test
	 * your code.
	 * 
	 * You can run a single test (e.g., testingtoString() below) by double-clicking
	 * on the method's name and selecting Run-->Run As-->JUnit Test.  You can also
	 * double-click on the method's name and select the white triangle that is inside
	 * of a green circle (under Navigate menu entry).
